# Continuous outcomes

## Comparative estimates with 95% confidence intervals

`type` | Description | Options (`arguments = `)
-------+-------------+--------------
`"diff"` | Mean difference from linear model. |
`"fold"` | Fold change from generalized linear model with log link (i.e., ratio of arithmetic means).
`"foldlog"` | Fold change from linear model after log transformation of the outcome (*i.e.*, ratio of geometric means).
`"quantreg"` | Quantile difference from quantile regression using `quantreg::rq()` with `method = "fn"`. By default, this is the difference in medians. | `list(tau = 0.75)` to change the quantile to, e.g., the 75th percentile.
   
## Absolute estimates per exposure category

`type` | Description | Options (`arguments = `)
-------+-------------+--------------
`"range"` | Range: Minimum to maximum value.
`"mean"` | Mean (arithmetic mean).
`"mean (ci)"` | Mean and 95% CI.
`"mean (sd)"` | Mean and standard deviation.
`"geomean"` | Geometric mean.
`"median"` | Median.
`"median (iqr)"` | Median and interquartile range.


# Binary outcomes

## Comparative estimates with 95% confidence intervals

`type` | Description | Options (`arguments = `)
-------+-------------+--------------
`"irr"`   | Incidence rate ratio for count outcomes from Poisson regression model.
`"irrrob"` | Ratio for other outcomes from Poisson regression model with robust (sandwich) standard errors.
`"or"` | Odds ratio from logistic regression.
`"rd"` | Risk difference (or prevalence difference) from risks::riskdiff(). | `list(approach = "margstd_boot", bootrepeats = 2000)` to request model fitting via marginal standardization with 2000 bootstraps.
`"rr"` | Risk ratio (or prevalence ratio) from `risks::riskratio()`. | See `"rd"`.

## Absolute estimates per exposure category

`type` | Description | Options (`arguments = `)
-------+-------------+--------------
`"cases/controls"` | Cases and non-cases (events and non-events); useful for case-control studies.
`"outcomes"` | Outcome count.
`"outcomes (risk)"` | A combination: Outcomes followed by risk in parentheses.
`"outcomes/total (risk)"` | A combination: Outcomes slash total followed by risk in parentheses.
`"risk"` | Risk (or prevalence), calculated as a proportion, *i.e.*, outcomes divided by number of observations. Change between display as proportion or percent using the parameter `risk_percent` of `rifttable()`.
`"risk (ci)"` | Risk with 95% confidence interval (Wilson score interval for binomial proportions, see `rifttable::scoreci()`).


# Time-to-event/survival outcomes

## Comparative estimates with 95% confidence intervals

`type` | Description | Options (`arguments = `)
-------+-------------+--------------
`"cumincdiff"` | Difference in cumulative incidence from Kaplan-Meier estimator. Cannot not handle confounders. Uses `rifttable::survdiff_ci()`. | `list(timepoint = 2.5)` to evaluate differences in cumulative incidence at 2.5 years.
`"hr"`    | Hazard ratio from Cox proportional hazards regression. | `list(robust = TRUE)` for robust (sandwich) standard errors; `list(weights = "weight_variable", robust = TRUE)` for sampling (e.g., inverse-probability) weights and robust errors. Use `"+ cluster(id_variable)"` in `confounders` to obtain clustering.
`"survdiff"` | Difference in survival from Kaplan-Meier estimator.  Cannot not handle confounders. Uses `rifttable::survdiff_ci()`. | `list(timepoint = 2.5)` to evaluate differences in survival at 2.5 years.

   
## Absolute estimates per exposure category

`type` | Description | Options (`arguments = `)
-------+-------------+--------------
`"cuminc"` | Cumulative incidence ("risk") from the Kaplan-Meier estimator. If no time point is provided, returns cumulative incidence at end of follow-up. Change between display as proportion or percent using the parameter `risk_percent` of `rifttable()`. | `list(timepoint = 2.5)` to show cumulative incidence at 2.5 years.
`"cuminc (ci)"` | Cumulative incidence ("risk") from the Kaplan-Meier estimator with 95% confidence intervals (Greenwood standard errors with log transformation, the default of the survival package/`survival::survfit()`). | See `"cuminc"`.
`"events"` | Event count.
`"events/time"` | Events slash person-time.
`"events/time (rate)"` | A combination: Events slash time followed by rate in parentheses.
`"events/total"` | Events slash number of observations.
`"rate"` | Event rate: event count divided by person-time, multiplied by the `rifttable()` parameter `factor`.
`"rate (ci)"` | Event rate with 95% confidence interval (Poisson-type large-sample interval).
`"surv"` | Survival from the Kaplan-Meier estimator. If no time point is provided, returns survival at end of follow-up. Change between display as proportion or percent using the parameter `risk_percent` of `rifttable()`. | `list(timepoint = 2.5)` to show survival at 2.5 years.
`"surv (ci)"` | Survival from the Kaplan-Meier estimator with 95% confidence interval (Greenwood standard errors with log transformation, the default of the survival package/`survival::survfit()`). | See `"surv"`.
`"time"` | Person-time.
`"maxfu"` | Maximum follow-up time.
`"medfu"` | Median follow-up (reverse Kaplan-Meier), equals median survival for censoring.
`"medfu (iqr)"` | Median and interquartile range for follow-up.
`"medsurv"` | Median survival.
`"medsurv (ci)"` | Median survival with 95% confidence interval.


# Joint models for comparative estimates

By default, regression models will be fit separately for each stratum of the `effect_modifier`. 

Append `"_joint"` to `"hr"`, `"rr"`, `"rd"`, `"irr"`, `"irrrob"`, `"diff"`, `"fold"`, `"foldlog"`, `"quantreg"`, or `"or"` to obtain "joint" models for exposure and effect modifier that have a single reference category.
 
Example: `type = "hr_joint"`.

Note that the joint model will be fit across all non-missing (`NA`) strata of the effect modifier, even if the `design` table does not request all strata be shown.


# Special types

`type` | Description | Options (`arguments = `)
-------+-------------+--------------
`"blank"` or `""` | An empty line
`"custom_function"` | A user-defined function. In this example, the corresponding function must be called `estimate_custom_function()` | Any
`"total"` | Number of observations.

The reference categories for exposure and effect modifier are their first factor levels, which can be changed using `forcats::fct_relevel()`.
