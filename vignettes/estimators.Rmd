# Comparative estimates with 95% confidence intervals

`type` | Description
-------+---------------------------
`"cumincdiff"` | Difference in cumulative incidence from Kaplan-Meier estimator. Provide time horizon, e.g., `"cumincdiff 2.5"` to evaluate differences in cumulative incidence at 2.5 years. Cannot not handle confounders. Uses `rifttable::survdiff_ci()`.
`"diff"` | Mean difference from linear model.
`"fold"` | Fold change from generalized linear model with log link (i.e., ratio of arithmetic means).
`"foldlog"` | Fold change from linear model after log transformation of the outcome (*i.e.*, ratio of geometric means).
`"hr"`    | Hazard ratio from Cox proportional hazards regression.
`"irr"`   | Incidence rate ratio for count outcomes from Poisson regression model.
`"irrrob"` | Ratio for other outcomes from Poisson regression model with robust (sandwich) standard errors.
`"or"` | Odds ratio from logistic regression.
`"quantreg"` | Quantile difference from quantile regression using `quantreg::rq()` with `method = "fn"`. By default, this is the difference in medians. For a different quantile, e.g., the 75th percentile, use `"quantreg 0.75"`.
`"rd"` | Risk difference (or prevalence difference) from risks::riskdiff(). Can request model fitting approach and bootstrap repeats as for `"rr"`.
`"rr"` | Risk ratio (or prevalence ratio) from `risks::riskratio()`. Can request specific model fitting  approach and, for marginal standardization only, the number of bootstrap repeats. | Examples: `"rrglm_start"` or `"rrmargstd 2000"`
`"survdiff"` | Difference in survival from Kaplan-Meier estimator. Provide time horizon, e.g., `"survdiff 2.5"` to evaluate differences in survival at 2.5 years. Cannot not handle confounders. `rifttable::survdiff_ci()`.

   
# Absolute estimates per exposure category

`type` | Description
-------+---------------------------
`"blank"` or `""` | An empty line
`"cuminc"` | Cumulative incidence ("risk") from the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Provide time point (e.g., 1.5-year cumulative incidence) using `"cuminc 1.5"`. If no time point is provided, returns cumulative incidence at end of follow-up. Change between display as proportion or percent using the parameter `risk_percent`.
`"cuminc (ci)"` | Cumulative incidence ("risk") from the Kaplan-Meier estimator with 95% confidence intervals (Greenwood standard errors with log transformation, the default of the survival package/`survival::survfit()`). Provide time point as in `"cuminc"`.
`"cases/controls"` | Cases and non-cases (events and non-events); useful for case-control studies.
`"custom"` | A custom function, provided to `rifttable()` through the parameter `custom`. See there for details. If a list of multiple functions is provided, use `"custom1"` through `"custom99"` to select one function.
`"events"` | Event count.
`"events/time"` | Events slash person-time.
`"events/time (rate)"` | A combination: Events slash time followed by rate in parentheses.
`"events/total"` | Events slash number of observations.
`"outcomes"` | Outcome count.
`"outcomes (risk)"` | A combination: Outcomes followed by risk in parentheses.
`"outcomes/total (risk)"` | A combination: Outcomes slash total followed by risk in parentheses.
`"range"` | Range: Minimum to maximum value.
`"rate"` | Event rate: event count divided by person-time, multiplied by the `rifttable()` parameter `factor`.
`"rate (ci)"` | Event rate with 95% confidence interval (Poisson-type large-sample interval).
`"risk"` | Risk (or prevalence), calculated as a proportion, *i.e.*, outcomes divided by number of observations. Change between display as proportion or percent using the parameter `risk_percent`.
`"risk (ci)"` | Risk with 95% confidence interval (Wilson score interval for binomial proportions, see `rifttable::scoreci()`).
`"surv"` | Survival from the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Provide time point (e.g., 1.5-year survival) using `"surv 1.5"`. If no time point is provided, returns survival at end of follow-up. Change between display as proportion or percent using the parameter `risk_percent`.
`"surv (ci)"` | Survival from the Kaplan-Meier estimator with 95% confidence interval (Greenwood standard errors with log transformation, the default of the survival package/`survival::survfit()`). Provide time point as in `"surv"`.
`"time"` | Person-time.
`"total"` | Number of observations.
`"maxfu"` | Maximum follow-up time.
`"mean"` | Mean.
`"mean (ci)"` | Mean and 95% CI.
`"mean (sd)"` | Mean and standard deviation.
`"medfu"` | Median follow-up (reverse Kaplan-Meier), equals median survival for censoring.
`"medfu (iqr)"` | Median and interquartile range for follow-up.
`"median"` | Median.
`"median (iqr)"` | Median and interquartile range.
`"medsurv"` | Median survival.
`"medsurv (ci)"` | Median survival with 95% confidence interval.

By default, regression models will be fit separately for each stratum of the `effect_modifier`. Append `"_joint"` to `"hr"`, `"rr"`, `"rd"`, `"irr"`, `"irrrob"`, `"diff"`, `"fold"`, `"foldlog"`, `"quantreg"`, or `"or"` to obtain "joint" models for exposure and effect modifier that have a single reference category.
 
Example: `type = "hr_joint"`. 
 
The reference categories for exposure and effect modifier are their first factor levels, which can be changed using `forcats::fct_relevel()`. Note that the joint model will be fit across all non-missing (`NA`) strata of the effect modifier, even if the `design` table does not request all strata be shown.
