Description: Presentation-ready results tables for epidemiologists in an 
    automated, reproducible fashion. The user provides the final analytical 
    dataset and specifies the design of the table, with rows and/or columns 
    defined by exposure(s), effect modifier(s), and estimands as desired, 
    allowing to show descriptors and inferential estimates in one table -- 
    bridging the rift between epidemiologists and their data, one table at a 
    time. See Rothman (2017) <doi:10.1007/s10654-017-0314-3>.
